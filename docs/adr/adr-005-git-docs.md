- [ADR-005: Documentation stored within repo](#adr-005-documentation-stored-within-repo)
- [Decision](#decision)

## Decision

- /docs folder to hold relevant technical documentation for the code in that repository
- Utilise this instead of internal confluence repositories
- Markdown as standard
- github pages for build and deploy
- Just the docs as the standard theme
