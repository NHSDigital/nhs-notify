## Development Goals

### Goals for ways of working

- A new developer should be able to start working and release code on day 1
- Releases are non events
- Clear separation of release, deploy and feature enablement
- Automate - move tests left, they run early
- Governance approval not to block release - gain feature approval early
- Full Stack, Full lifetime teams - design it, build it, maintain it, support it
- Small teams with clearly defined ownership of code / sub-domains
- Open source, both code and developer documentation

### Principles to follow

- Do not link to any sites are resources that have restricted access
- Do not assume that a reader has access to any internal NHS resources
